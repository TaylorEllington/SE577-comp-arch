# SE577 Computer Architecture

## About me

My name is Taylor Ellington and I am a masters level graduate student at Drexel. I am a full time Graphics Software Engineer at Intel, and have been for about 5 years at this point. Primarily I work in C++, on desktop application level software so web technologies are a bit out of my wheel house but I figure I can learn the technologies and expand my skill set during this class. 

I am mostly looking to get a better understanding of what a Software Architect does and to determine if that is a direction I want to move in my career.  I have enjoyed these years of writing code, and so moving towards a management style position may not be super appealing to me just yet, but fostering an understanding of the role and its responsibilities will help my career as I find more senior roles.
